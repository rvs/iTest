This project will develop a set of JarRunner adapters to perform the following
tasks via specific adapters:
  - provide a list of files within a jar file (artifact) which can be passed to a test
    framework such as JUnit for further execution (generic adapter)
  - request a list of tests from an artifact to be execute by an external
    framework (specific adapter)
  - get a list of tests within an artifact, supply them with certain arguments
    and run as POJO applications (concrete adapter: an extension of generic)

This project contains the experimental foundation of JarRunner and a
meta-service utilizing it to perform tests execution. These two components
might be joined together later.
